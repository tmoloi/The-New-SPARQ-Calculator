# The-New-SPARQ-Calculator
Created a calculator (AKA SPARQ rating, coined by Nike), to measure the athletic scores of athletes.
Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Tests measured: 40 yard dash, Vertical Jump, 20 yard Shuttle, Bench Press, Squat, Hang/Power Clean
Used simple number comparisons to apply scores for each test
Updates coming soon, this is still the first delpoyment of the application, and my very first self-made front-end app.
Created with CodeSandbox
